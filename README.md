Real Estate Price Analysis Project
Project Overview
In this project, we analyze a residential real estate dataset to identify and understand the variables that significantly influence house prices. Through a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering, we uncover patterns, correlations, and trends that help inform strategic pricing decisions.

Objectives
Conduct an in-depth analysis of real estate data to extract meaningful insights.
Identify the most influential factors affecting house prices.
Create a comprehensive EDA and develop new features for better predictive analysis.
Provide actionable recommendations to enhance pricing strategies.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features such as:

Location information (e.g., neighborhood).
Property characteristics (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms).
Amenities (e.g., pool, garage, fireplaces).
Historical data (e.g., year built).
Data Dictionary
Refer to the data dictionary for detailed descriptions of each feature in the dataset.

Methodology
1. Data Loading and Cleaning
Imported the dataset and loaded it into a Pandas DataFrame.
Addressed missing values, handled duplicates, and resolved data inconsistencies.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: Analyzed individual features like SalePrice, GrLivArea, etc., to understand their distributions.
Multivariate Analysis: Explored correlations between key features and SalePrice using heatmaps and scatterplots.
3. Feature Engineering
Created new features to enhance analysis:
Price per Square Foot: Calculated as SalePrice divided by GrLivArea.
Property Age: Derived from YearBuilt.
Total Bathrooms: Combined full and half bathrooms for a consolidated metric.
4. Market Trends and Historical Pricing
Analyzed trends in house prices over time, considering YearBuilt and neighborhood data.
Examined average sale prices by neighborhood to identify high-value areas.
5. Customer Preferences and Amenities Analysis
Analyzed the impact of specific amenities (e.g., pools, garages, fireplaces) on house prices.
Used clustering to identify distinct market segments based on amenity profiles.
Key Findings
Properties with larger square footage and certain amenities (e.g., pools, garages) generally command higher prices.
Newer properties and certain high-demand neighborhoods have higher average prices.
Clustering analysis revealed distinct customer segments, allowing for targeted pricing strategies.
Recommendations
Implement pricing adjustments based on size and amenities.
Focus marketing on high-demand neighborhoods and features.
Consider collecting additional data on economic indicators and customer sentiment to refine analysis.
